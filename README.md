# Stellar Development Skill

A comprehensive AI skill for modern Stellar development (January 2026 best practices).

Inspired by [solana-foundation/solana-dev-skill](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-dev-skill) and [cloudflare/skills](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills).

> [!NOTE]
> This skill was AI-generated using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and is currently under manual review. We welcome contributions! Please submit PRs, open issues, or provide feedback to help improve this resource for the Stellar ecosystem.

## Overview

This skill provides AI assistants with deep knowledge of the current Stellar development ecosystem:

- **Smart Contracts**: Soroban (Rust SDK, WebAssembly)
- **Client SDKs**: stellar-sdk (JavaScript), Python, Go, Rust
- **APIs**: Stellar RPC (preferred), Horizon (legacy)
- **Assets**: Stellar Assets, Stellar Asset Contract (SAC)
- **Wallets**: Freighter, Stellar Wallets Kit, Smart Accounts (passkeys)
- **Testing**: Local Quickstart, Testnet, Unit tests
- **Security**: Soroban-specific patterns, audit checklists
- **Ecosystem**: DeFi protocols, developer tools, community projects

The skill uses a progressive disclosure pattern. The main `SKILL.md` provides core guidance, and the AI reads the specialized markdown files only when needed for specific tasks.

## Example Prompts

```
"Help me write a Soroban smart contract for a token"
"Set up a Next.js app with Freighter wallet connection"
"How do I deploy a contract to Stellar Testnet?"
"Create unit tests for my Soroban contract"
"Review this contract for security issues"
```
